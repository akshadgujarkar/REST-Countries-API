### REST Countries API Website

This repository contains the source code for my REST Countries API website, a project I completed as part of a challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge was an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

#### Features:
- **Country Search**: Search for countries by name.
- **Detailed Information**: View comprehensive details about each country, including population, region, capital, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes to ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout to make the site visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and data fetching from the REST Countries API.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of front-end development and improved my ability to integrate APIs effectively. Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback!
